			<P>Web archiving is the process of gathering up data that has been recorded on the World Wide Web, storing it, ensuring the data is preserved in an archive, and making the collected data available for future research (Niu 2012, 1). Elements of traditional archival practice, such as selection and acquisition, have been modified for web archiving, and are just as important. Much as how archives can not accept every item someone wants to donate, as it may be outside of the institution's scope, the Internet is vast, and web archiving projects typically have a limited scope in order to save digital space and time.</P>
			<p>Websites are archived via a method known as crawling, which is when web crawlers, also known as spiders, harvest content from web servers and download web content, following hyperlinks to discover and download additional web content (Niu 2012, 4). The average lifespan of a website is about 2 years, with most lasting less. Web archiving is an avenue to preserving these websites and their content, and some GLAM institutions have adopted web archiving projects in order to preserve digital exhibitions hosted on their website. Web archiving can even be utilized by individuals, especially in the academic sphere. Web archiving is another way of saving sources, especially for projects around social issues that involve social media. Social media can be easily deleted or modified, so taking a screenshot or crawling the website individually on that day is another way to preserve what was occurring then, instead of returning back later to see a tweet or article had been deleted because of backlash or other reasons. </p>
			<p>Not every institution has the ability to host its own web archiving projects, and that is where the Internet Archive comes in. A non-profit website, the Internet Archive is building a digital library of Internet sites and other cultural artifacts in digital form (Internet Archive, n.d.). Beginning in 1996, 25+ years of web history is now accessible through the Wayback Machine, and the development of the Archive-It program has connected the Internet Archive with 950+ libraries and other partners. The web archive currently contains over 681 billion web pages. </p>
			<p>In order to upload content, a user just has to register with the Archive. You can then save a webpage at any time to the Wayback Machine, as long as the website you are saving allows crawlers. If a user wants to search for a website, they just need to enter the website URL into the search bar, and then they can browse by date to see a website evolve over time. </p>
			<p>AllMusic started in 1991 and became available on the Internet in 1994. AllMusic is an American online music database that catalogs more than three million album entries and 30 million tracks, as well as information on musicians and bands. Starting in 1998, the Digitial Image Archive of Medieval Music (DIAMM) is the leading resource for the study of medieval manuscripts and is the most complete listing of medieval and early modern manuscripts of western polyphony. Last.fm is a music website founded in 2002 that builds a detailed profile for each user's musical taste by recording details of the tracks the user listens to, either from the Internet radio stations, the user's computer, or many portable music devices. MusicBrainz was launched in 2000 and is an open music encyclopedia that collects music metadata and makes it available to the public. Spotify is an audio streaming and media services provider founded in 2006. It is one of the largest music streaming service providers with over 406 million monthly active users.   </p>
			<p>This project will be utilizing the Wayback Machine to look at music database design, and how it has evolved from 2000 to today. Spotify, MusicBrainz, the Digital Image Archive of Medieval Music (DIAMM), Last.fm, and AllMusic will be looked at in 6-year intervals starting from 2000 and will be evaluating using UX heuristic evaluation standards, as well as Information Architecture guidelines and web design trends. </p>
